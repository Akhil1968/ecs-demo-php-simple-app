Jenkins requires Java 1.8. However, Amazon Linux comes pre-installed with Java 1.7. So, replace 1.7 with 1.8.

	yum remove java-1.7.0-openjdk
	
jq is a command-line utility for parsing JSON output. It will be used in CICD deploy script 
    yum install jq -y
	  
Add the Jenkins repository URL to yum so that yum knows where to install Jenkins from.
	wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo http://pkg.jenkins-ci.org/redhat/jenkins.repo

Add the Jenkins GPG key to our trusted keys so that we’re able to install Jenkins, verifying that the files are being sourced from a trusted location
	rpm --import http://pkg.jenkins-ci.org/redhat/jenkins-ci.org.key

After readying our environment with the required dependancies, now we can install Jenkins
	yum install jenkins

Run the following commands to add user jenkins to docker demon process
	usermod -a -G docker jenkins
	service jenkins start
